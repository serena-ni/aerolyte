This is my journal of the design and building process of **Mini Air Quality Monitor**.

## 10/17/2025 - Wrote the Arduino code  

I wrote the initial Arduino sketch for Aerolyte, my mini air-quality monitor. I set up the code to read values from the MQ-135 sensor and display air quality categories on the OLED screen. I tested the logic with simulated sensor values since I donâ€™t have the hardware yet. Everything compiled successfully, and the display logic seems to work as expected.
