This is my journal of the design and building process of **Mini Air Quality Monitor**.

## 10/17/2025 - Wrote the Arduino code  

I wrote the initial Arduino sketch for Aerolyte, my mini air-quality monitor. I set up the code to read values from the MQ-135 sensor and display air quality categories on the OLED screen. I tested the logic with simulated sensor values since I don’t have the hardware yet. Everything compiled successfully, and the display logic seems to work as expected.

## 10/18/2025 - Created BOM  

Today I wrote the BOM for my Aerolyte mini air quality monitor. I listed all the components I’ll need, including the Nano 3.0 board, OLED display, breadboard, jumper wires, and USB cable. I felt very confused at first because I’ve never done a hardware project like this before, but breaking it down piece by piece helped me understand what’s needed. Now I have a clear parts list ready for ordering.
