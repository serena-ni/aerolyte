# aerolyte

## Overview
aerolyte is a small, beginner-friendly air-quality sensor project built using an Arduino Nano, an MQ-135 gas sensor module, and a 0.96" OLED display. The device reads basic air-quality values and displays them in real time.

## Why I Made This Project
I created aerolyte to learn hands-on hardware skills for the first time. I’ve worked on software projects before, but I wanted to challenge myself by building something physical, wiring components, writing firmware, and understanding how microcontrollers work.
